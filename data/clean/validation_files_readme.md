# Validation Files 

This is purely for internal record-keeping since the raw Qualtrics files of PIDs. Here I am reminding us of the mappings between
CSVs and Qualtrics experiments. 

## Shallow Preferences

- `deep_shallow_w_prima.csv`. This maps to the Qualtrics experiment `deep_shallow_prima`. In this initial validation, we had 
n=28 people randomized to either (A) shallow condition or (B) neutral/broad condition. For the shallow condition, we used prima facie duties only. We also used all of them, 
including gratitude. 

- `deep_shallow_basic_values.csv`. This maps to the Qualtrics experiment `deep_shallow_schwartz`. We re-ran the deep/shallow annotation, but for the Schwartz values.

## Completion annotations 

- `dvb_cb_test.csv`. This is 20 participants who were given (1) a completion and (2) info about a user's preference for v1 > v2. Then the participant picked which choice participant would make. This maps to Qualtrics experiment dvb_cb_test
