# Validation Files 

This is mostly for internal record-keeping/atlas. 

## Shallow Preferences

- `deep_shallow_w_prima.csv`. This maps to the Qualtrics experiment `deep_shallow_prima`. In this initial validation, we had 
n=28 people randomized to either (A) shallow condition or (B) neutral/broad condition. For the shallow condition, we used prima facie duties only. We also used all of them, 
including gratitude.
